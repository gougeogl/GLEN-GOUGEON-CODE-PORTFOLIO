# Shell Program in C Documentation #
* Program Name:	smallsh.c
* Programmer: 	*Glen Gougeon* 
* Date: 		9-27-20

### Description:
This is an implementation of a BASH-like shell I created for my
Operating Systems class. It can handle changing directories, 
calling other Linux programs such as ls, pwd, date and others.
You can even open vim within the shell and use it.

#### QUICK START GUIDE
1. run git clone https://github.com/gougeogl/PROGRAM-SAMPLES.git
2. go to file **SHELL_in_C**
3. run chmod +x testshell (if not green ..means executable)
4a. Add . to PATH env var. run **testshell**
4b. run ./testshell
5. re-run steps 4a/4b *or* start manually. run *smallsh* then follow **Syntax** section below
#### Features:

###### The Prompt
* Semi-colon **:** is the prompt

###### To Comment
* Comments are entered as a hashtag **#**

##### Entering Commands
* Syntax
**command** arg1 arg2 arg3 .. arg-n **<** inputFile  outputFile **>** &

###### Built-In Commands
Command | cd | status | exit
--------|----|--------|-----
behavior | changes directory | returns the last process completion or the last signal | exits shell

###### IO Input/Output Redirection Accepted
Character | < | > | &
----------|---|---|--
behavior  | input | output | /dev/null (background only)

*Modified signal behavior*
BASH utilyzes the ampersand (&) symbol to place running programs 
in the background. This shell behaves the same way. Any trailing
ampersand is interpreted as a **BACKGROUND** process request.

###### Control Characters Chart
 Key | Control-C | Control-Z
-----|-----------|----------
behavior | stops fg processes only | toggles fore-ground-only mode on/off

###### Signals & PIDS (process ids')
* Printing of pids and signals occurs when
    * starting a background process
    * a bg process finished on its own
    * a bg foreground process is terminated 
        * Cntl-C

###### Notifications
* Information and error messages can occur
    * when generated by smallsh.c
        * Cntl-C kills a fg-child process
    * generated by other Linux programs
    * when entering fg-only mode
    * when exiting fg-only mode

##### Bugs
1. Foreground-only mode (Cntl-Z) DOES NOT WORK
   under Ubuntu 18.04 LTS App Win10 Home Platform
   1. This is known by MS but currently unsolved
       1. A 3rd-party library exist for this problem
